Description
===========
A box of 719 molecules of tetrahydrofuran of a total of 9347 atoms
is used to benchmark several functionalities of fullrmc. This example 
is very useful to test the performance of fullrmc. Benchmarking might 
take several hours. At the end of this example benchmark data will
be saved and two matplotlib figures will be plotted.

Files
=====
#. experimental.gr: x-rays pair distribution function data of tetrahydrofuran liquid
#. system.pdb: The initial configuration input file
#. run.py: The script file used to run the simulation

:underline:`IMPORTING USEFUL DEFINITIONS:` 

All useful packages, modules and definitions are imported.


:underline:`SHUT DOWN LOGGING:` 

Set logger minimum level to maximum possible integer value. This will mute
all non-error logging. 


:underline:`CREATE ENGINE:` 

Create the engine and all of :class:`PairDistributionConstraint`, 
:class:`InterMolecularDistanceConstraint`, :class:`BondConstraint`, 
:class:`BondsAngleConstraint` and :class:`ImproperAngleConstraint` constraints.


:underline:`DIFFERENT RUNS:` 

Define functions to run the fitting engine or to visualize saved benchmarks. 
   #. run: Allows multiple arguments and sets the engine to run a specific 
      benchmark.
   #. benchmark_constraints: run and save benchmarks on constraints using 
      different group sizes.
   #. benchmark_nsteps: run and save benchmarks on number of steps using a  
      fixed group size and set of constraints.
   #. load_and_plot_constraints_benchmark: load and plot saved constraints benchmarks.
   #. load_and_plot_steps_benchmark: load and plot saved number of steps benchmarks.

   
:underline:`RUN SIMULATION:` 

benchmark_constraints and benchmark_nsteps functions are called and benchmarks are
shown at the end


:underline:`PLOT BENCHMARKS:` 

If uncommented, load_and_plot_steps_benchmark and load_and_plot_constraints_benchmark 
functions will be called.
