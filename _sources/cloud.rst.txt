======================================
fullrmc runs a stochastic engine that runs as a sequential process. To speed
up the calculation for big systems, pthreads are used to parallelize certain
parts of the computation blocks. This turns out to be beneficial when the
number of atoms in the system is big enough to compensate for the overhead
of launching the parallel processing on every and each step.

On the other hand when the studied atomic system is constituted of a mixture
of different structures (distribution of nanoparticles size, local structures
and nano-grains, distribution of structure faults, interface structures, etc.)
and systems then a single atomic system simulation will never be enough to get
an accurate solution. For that particular reason in fullrmc we introduce the
concept of 'multiframe' and we use softgrid_ to enable running fullrmc's
multiframe on any set of connected commodity hardware to perform synchronous
and asynchronous multiframe computation.

softgrid_ is not open sourced and it can't be distributed along with fullrmc.
Therefore fullrmc softgrid_ enabled will be available as software as as
solution on cloud infrastructures such as Microsoft AZURE.
