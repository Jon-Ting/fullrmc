Description
===========
Here a single molecule is used to demonstrate how to use certain rotation  
move generators. This example was used to generate the `rotation video example 
<https://youtu.be/-clLvYiaC8w?list=PLdnpUo5ObkNbe4ZPe9ndormg2qUFbOmco>`_ 
as seen in the online documentation. When running this example several files
will be generated where all moved are saved. If 
`VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_. is installed, the trajectory
of all moves will be automatically visualized. 
   
Files
=====
#. molecule.pdb: The single molecule structure
#. run.py: The script file used to run the simulation

:underline:`IMPORTING USEFUL DEFINITIONS:` 

All useful packages, modules and definitions are imported.


:underline:`SHUT DOWN LOGGING:` 

Set logger minimum level to maximum possible integer value. This will mute
all non-error logging. 


:underline:`CREATE ENGINE:` 

Create the engine and set the only molecule as a rigid body. This is done
automatically because set_groups_as_molecules will only find one molecule. 


:underline:`DIFFERENT RUNS:` 

Define functions to run fitting engine. All of the following functions finish 
running the engine using Engine.run method. A trajectory of all moves is saved
to the disk by setting XYZPath argument not to None.
   #. about_axis_0: Used to rotate the molecule about its principal axis
   #. about_axis_1: Used to rotate the molecule about its secondary axis
   #. about_axis_2: Used to rotate the molecule about its tertiary axis
   #. about_111_axis: Used to rotate the molecule about [x=1, y=1, z=1] axis
   #. random: Used to rotate the molecule randomly


:underline:`RUN SIMULATION:` 

All five functions are called consecutively.


:underline:`VISUALIZE SIMULATION:` 

Reset initial pdb to engine instance. Visualize engine along with all saved 
four trajectories "about0.xyz", "about1.xyz", "about2.xyz", "about111.xyz", "random.xyz".
