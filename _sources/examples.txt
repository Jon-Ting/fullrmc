Available examples
==================
**It is not allowed to use any of the examples materials' outside of 
the scope of this tutorial. Experimental data and models distributed
in the examples are even wrong or tricked to serve the purpose of 
learning fullrmc.**

Herein is a list of all available examples in the standard distribution.
A short description of each example is shown in the list below. It is 
recommended not to run any example from within fullrmc. But copy the
example folder to any safe place such as one's home directory and run it  
from there. To locate an example and copy it, one can do the following:

.. code-block:: python  
       
         # import find_example
         from fullrmc.Examples import find_example
         # search for an examples. e.g. atomicNiTi
         print find_example('atomicNiTi')
         
         >>> '../site-packages/fullrmc/Examples/atomicNiTi'

         
In all examples, run.py is the name of the file that must be  
executed from the command line as the following:

.. code-block:: bash  
       
          python run.py

          
Examples folder name is used as the click-able items in the following list.


:underline:`Constraints:`

*  `coordNumConstraint <fullrmc.Examples.coordinationNumberConstraint.html>`__: 
   Used to show how to coordination number constraint works.
*  `bondsConstraint <fullrmc.Examples.bondsConstraint.html>`__: Used to show 
   how bonds constraint works.
*  `anglesConstraint <fullrmc.Examples.anglesConstraint.html>`__: Used to show 
   how angles constraint works.
*  `improperConstraint <fullrmc.Examples.improperConstraint.html>`__: Used to show 
   how improper angles constraint works.


:underline:`Generators:`

*  `translations <fullrmc.Examples.translations.html>`__: Used show how to 
   use translation generators.
*  `rotations <fullrmc.Examples.rotations.html>`__: To show how to use 
   rotation generators.
*  `agitations <fullrmc.Examples.agitations.html>`__: To show how to 
   use agitation generators.

   
:underline:`Fitting modes:`

*  `docking <fullrmc.Examples.docking.html>`__: To show how to move 
   one group of atoms towards another.
*  `explore <fullrmc.Examples.explore.html>`__: This is a simulation of a molecule
   exploring a cavity. 
*  `refine <fullrmc.Examples.refine.html>`__: This is a simulation of a molecule
   refining its position in a cavity.
*  `ExploreCO2 <fullrmc.Examples.exploreCO2.html>`__: This is a fit of CO2 gas
   in critical condition.  

   
:underline:`Selectors:`

*  `MLSelection <fullrmc.Examples.MLSelection.html>`__: In this example we show
   that reinforcement machine learning can help increasing accepted moves ratio.


:underline:`Benchmarks:`

*  `benchmark <fullrmc.Examples.benchmark.html>`__: This example can be used to 
   benchmark fullrmc.
*  `multicoreBenchmark <fullrmc.Examples.multicoreBenchmark.html>`__: This is used to
   benchmark multicore computation. 


:underline:`Real systems:`

*  `atomicNiTi <fullrmc.Examples.atomicNiTi.html>`__: Fitting a Ni-Ti memory   
   shape binary compound.
*  `molecularTHF <fullrmc.Examples.molecularTHF.html>`__: This is a tetrahydrofuran 
   electrolyte system fitting.
*  `SiOxNanosphere <fullrmc.Examples.SiOxNanosphere.html>`__: This is an isolated silicon 
   oxide nanosphere fitting. 
   
:underline:`Frames:`   

*  `frames <fullrmc.Examples.frames.html>`__: Fitting the same Ni-Ti memory shape binary  
   compound as in example `atomicNiTi <fullrmc.Examples.atomicNiTi.html>`__. But in 
   this example we define different frames and build different fitting processes all
   contained in the same engine.
