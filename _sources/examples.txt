.. automodule:: fullrmc.Examples 

Available examples
==================
**It is not allowed to use any of the examples materials' outside of 
the scope of this tutorial. Experimental data and models distributed
in the examples are even wrong or tricked to serve the purpose of 
learning fullrmc.**

Herein is a list of all available examples in the standard distribution.
A short description of each example is shown in the list below. It is 
recommended not to run any example from within fullrmc. But copy the
example folder to any safe place such your home directory and run it from 
there. To locate an example and copy it, one can do the following:

.. code-block:: python  
       
         # import find_example
         from fullrmc.Examples import find_example
         # search for an examples. e.g. atomicNiTi
         print find_example('atomicNiTi')
         
         >>> '../site-packages/fullrmc/Examples/atomicNiTi'

         
In all examples, run.py is the name of the file that muse be  
executed from the command line as the following:

.. code-block:: bash  
       
          python run.py

          
Examples folder name is used as the click-able items in the following list.

#. `translations <fullrmc.Examples.translations.html>`__: Used show how to 
   use translation generators.
#. `rotations <fullrmc.Examples.rotations.html>`__: Used to show how to 
   use rotation generators.
