History
=======
FUndamental Library Language for Reverse Monte Carlo or fullrmc  
project has started in 2015 as a consequence of the incapability 
of modelling complex atomic systems' structure. Since fullrmc was 
published a first official release 0.2.0 was made. Later, successive  
releases were made as needed.
